# 🦈 CyberJaw – Hotplug Network Attack Device

> **A compact, plug-and-play cyber tool for red teams and pentesters.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**CyberJaw** is a stealthy, Raspberry Pi Zero 2W–based network attack device inspired by the [Shark Jack](https://hak5.org/products/shark-jack). Built for red team operations and network reconnaissance, CyberJaw discreetly plugs into a network and immediately begins scanning, sniffing, or launching scripted payloads.

Whether you're auditing network infrastructure or simulating insider threats, CyberJaw provides a pocket-sized edge.
